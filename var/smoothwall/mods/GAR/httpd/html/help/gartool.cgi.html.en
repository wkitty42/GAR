<P>This page allows you to disable, modify or enable SNORT rules by adding
them to the OINKMaster control file. When OINKMaster processes rules sets
updates, it will automatically disable, modify or enable the listed rules.
This is desirable because the rule updates will overwrite any manual
changes you have made to the rules.</P>
<hr>
<P><B>Usage:</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>To look up the SID for the rule you want to modify, enter some of the descriptive
phrase in the search box and press the 'SEARCH' button. This is an EXACT MATCH search.</LI>

<LI>Put the desired modification info in the editing box as shown in the example. You
do not need to enter a comment if you do not want to, it is an option and a highly
recommended one.</LI>

<LI>Click on the 'Save Rules' button to save the entered lines. You <b>must</b>
do this before clicking on any other buttons or you will loose your work!</LI>

<LI>The new line(s) will be written to the config file and will appear in the display
window.</LI>

<LI>Once you have created all the modification rules you need, then click on the 'Run
OINKMaster and Reload SNORT' button.</LI>

<LI>After OINKMaster has been run, the sid-msg.map file will be updated with the current
list of SIDs and rules.</LI>

<LI>There is also a section where you can add your own SNORT rules to the local.rules file.
As above, after entering all the rules, click the 'Save local.rules File' button to save your
work. Then click on the 'Run OINKMaster and Reload SNORT' button to activate your rules.</LI>

<LI>Once again, after OINKMaster has been run, the sid-msg.map file will be updated with
the current list of SIDs and rules.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>WARNING:</B> There is no error checking for validating the structure of any rules. The
creation of rules in local.rules will likely require you to perform some research at
the <a href="http://www.snort.org/" target="_BLANK">SNORT website</a>.</P>

<P>Please go to <a href="http://community.smoothwall.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25041" target="_BLANK">the support thread</a> in
the SmoothWall3 Homebrew forum for any help needed with this mod.</P>

<P><B>Details:</B></P>

<P><b><u>disablesid:</u></b></P>

<P>SIDs to disable after each update.<BR>
Will simply place a '#' in front of the specified SID.
Multi-line rules will have a '#' put in front of all lines.<BR>
<BR>
Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;disablesid SID<br>
or:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disablesid SID1, SID2, SID3, ...<BR>
<BR>
It's a good idea to also add comment about why you disabled the sid.<br>
<br>
disablesid 1324&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# 20020101: disabled this SID just because I can.
</P>
<br>
<P><b><u>enablesid:</u></b></P>

<P>SIDs to enable after each update.<BR>
Will simply remove all the leading '#' for a specified SID.
Multi-line rules will have the leading '#' for all lines removed.
These will be processed after all the modifysid and disablesid
statements. Using 'enablesid' on a rule that is not disabled is a
NOOP.<BR>
<BR>
Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;enablesid SID<br>
or:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enablesid SID1, SID2, SID3, ...<BR>
<BR>
It's a good idea to also add comment about why you enabled the sid.<br>
<br>
enablesid 1324&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# 20020101: enabled this SID just because I can.
</P>
<br>
<P><b><u>modifysid:</u></b></P>

<P>SIDs to modify after each update (only for the skilled/stupid/brave).<BR>
<BR>
<b>Don't use this unless you have to! There is nothing that stops you from
modifying rules in such ways that they become invalid or generally
break things. <u>You have been warned.</u></b><BR>
<BR>
If you just want to disable SIDs, please skip this section and have a
look at the "disablesid" keyword above.<BR>
<BR>
You may specify multiple modifysid directives for the same SID (they
will be processed in order of appearance), and you may also specify a
list of SIDs on which the substitution should be applied.
If the argument is in the form something.something it is regarded
as a filename and the substitution will apply on all rules in that
file. The wildcard ("*") can be used to apply the substitution on all
rules regardless of the SID or file. Please avoid using #comments
at the end of modifysid lines, they may confuse the parser in some
situations.<br>
<br>
Syntax:
&nbsp;&nbsp;modifysid SID "replacethis" | "withthis"<br>
or:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;modifysid SID1, SID2, SID3, ... "replacethis" | "withthis"<br>
or:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;modifysid file "replacethis" | "withthis"<br>
or:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;modifysid * "replacethis" | "withthis"<br>
<br>
The strings within the quotes will simply be passed to a
s/replacethis/withthis/ statement in Perl, so they must be valid
regular expressions. The strings are case-sensitive and only the first
occurrence will be replaced. If there are multiple occurrences you
want to replace, simply repeat the same modifysid line.<BR>
<BR>
If you specify a modifysid statement for a multi-line rule, Oinkmaster
will first translate the rule into a single-line version and then
perform the substitution, so you don't have to care about the trailing
backslashes and newlines.<BR>
<BR>
If you use variables in the substitution expression, it is strongly
recommended to always specify them like ${varname} instead of
$varname (like ${1} instead of $1 for example) to avoid parsing
confusion in some situations. Note that modifysid statements
will process both active and inactive (disabled) rules.<BR>
